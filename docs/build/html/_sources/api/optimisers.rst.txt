Optimisers
==========

The optimiser module contains the :code:`NamedOptimiser` class which is used
for optimisation of model hyperparameters. This module is used for all model
types and thus in order to create custom model classes, outputs from the model
must be compatible with the requirements of the :code:`NamedOptimiser` class.
