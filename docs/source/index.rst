XPOT Documentation
================================

**XPOT** is a Python package for automated optimisation of hyperparameters when 
fitting machine learning potentials for chemistry. 

This documentation is a work in progress, and will be updated as the package is 
developed.

.. note:: 
   XPOT currently supports ACE, SNAP, and GAP potentials, and work continues on 
   adding support for other potentials.
