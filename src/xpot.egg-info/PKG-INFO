# XPOT: Cross-Platform Hyperparameter Optimizer for Machine Learning Potentials

This software package provides an interface to machine learning (ML) potential fitting methods and allows for the automated optimization of relevant hyperparameters.

The software is described in [ref].

### Installation Instructions

Only compatible with `python >= 3.10`. Older python version may work, but have not been tested.

**PIP INSTALLATION:**
```
pip install --upgrade git+https://{username}:{generated-access-token}@git.chem.ox.ac.uk/vld-group/xpot.git@xpot-v2
```

After this - you must install pacemaker, gap_fit, fitSNAP, and/or mace yourself, for fitting to work properly.

Python Packages:
- LAMMPS python interface
- scikit-optimize
- numpy
- hjson
- pandas
- matplotlib
- ase
- tabulate
- quippy-ase >=0.9.0 (GAP potentials only)
- FitSNAP (SNAP potentials only) https://fitsnap.github.io/
- pacemaker (ACE potentials only) https://pacemaker.readthedocs.io/
- mace-torch (MACE potentials only) https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace/

1. Create a virtual environment, and insure that cmake is installed.

2. pip install the required python packages, before adding fitSNAP3 and pacemaker via their respective gits. Specific instructions for these packages can be found in their respective documentation pages, listed above.

3. Clone this github repository to a location of your choice.

4. place the following into your .bashrc. `export PYTHONPATH="XPOP_FOLDER_PATH":$PYTHONPATH`.

5. Try `import xpop`. 

### Usage

To use XPOT, please check out the example notebooks & python files included in the examples folder. These will demonstrate the input `hjson` and `python` files required.
